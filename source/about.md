Oh, hi there! I'm Remo, just another Developer from Switzerland.
Currently i like working with [Laravel](http://laravel.com) and [VueJS](http://vuejs.org).

Back in my days (aka 5 Years ago) i've started with Java and C# (especially MVC), so i'm not just a PHP Script kiddie.
By now i've developed several Web-Applications and smaller CMS's for customers and for myself.

If you would like to have a look at my work, check out my [Github](http://github.com/remoblaser) Profile.

The undoubtful best HTML/CSS Framework Bootstrap is close to release it's 4th version. I've taken a few minutes to introduce to you, my top 4 changes.

## IE8 thrown away, introducing rem and em
Bootstrap is "rolling with the changes", IE8 support is dropped and the used measurement size has changed from pixels to [rem and em](https://j.eremy.net/confused-about-rem-and-em/).
This allows a better responsive behaviour of font sizes and general sizes.


## Reworked all JavaScript plugins
With Bootstrap 4 all JavaScript plugins have been reworked with [ES6](http://es6-features.org/). This means, we will experience performance imporvements.
Additionally, due to the fact it's ES6, we will also be introduced to features like UMD support, generic teardown methods, option type checking and many more.


## Replacing LESS with SASS
Some will probably not agree with me but i'm very happy Bootstrap moved to SASS!

With the drop of [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) for [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), compiling will be faster and more lightweight.
Bootstrap will join a awesome community full of SASS lovers (not to confuse with the Ashley Madison lovers!).


## Reworked Documentation
We will be greeted by a new Documentation, not only telling us all the new features but also showing us more examples.
Additionally the search functionality has improved, this means, we will learn the same amount much faster.


Closing out, i think the Bootstrap is on a very good path. The changes made in version 4 are well thought.
